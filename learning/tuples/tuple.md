- we use ()
- The elements are immutable.(elements cannot be changed.)
## Creation
- we have to consider the tuple_name =(1, 2, 3, 4)
- here we also use indexing to refer to the elemenrs of the tuple. remember it is IMMUTABLE(NO CHANGE)
## Updating the tuple
-  The update we're talking about is that we combine say two tupples into one or we add a value and a tuple into a new tuple.
- del keyword deletes the entire tuple 
## Removing an element => 
we canot delete an element because it is immmutable
## accessing an element of a tuple
- we can access an element by slicing
## slicing
# Operations on Tupples.
