## CLASS
+ It is a blueprint followed by objects. It is also a logical structure with a behaviour.
+ A class can have atttributes and functions(the functions are also called class methods)
{attributes and methods are called class members}
+ a class can have multiple objects.
## Object
>> It is an instance of a class. 
an oject can also have attributes and methods of the class.
## Abstraction
>> Hidding the implimentation details and showing the essential  details
## Encapsulation
>> Wrapping up of data and funtion in a single entity
Public - Accesed by any function in any class(low level data protection)
protected - accessed by the only class the data was declared or inherited(medium)
private - only class the data is declared(high level)
## Inheritance
Derived class(chilld) inherits the properties of the base class(parent).
### Single inheritance
- it inherits the variables and mothods of the parent class.
## Polymorphism
>> Implimenting same methods in different context.
